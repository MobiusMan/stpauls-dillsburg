## About

## What's Included

- Responsive Layout: Looks good on phones, tablets, and desktops.
- Custom Theme: A WordPress theme I made to match the church’s vibe.
- Events & Sermons: Easy-to-update sections for church events and sermon content.
- SEO Basics: Set up to help locals find the church online.
